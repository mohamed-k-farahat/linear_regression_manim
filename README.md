# Linear Regression Visualization with Manim

This repository contains a visual demonstration of the **Linear Regression** algorithm using **Manim**, a powerful mathematical animation library. The project visualizes how the algorithm calculates the **best-fit line** by minimizing errors (residuals) between predicted and actual values.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Project Overview**

The animation in this project demonstrates the following:
- **Linear Regression**: Visualizing how the algorithm fits a line to a set of data points.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Highlighting how errors between the predicted values and the actual data points are minimized.
- **Best-Fit Line Calculation**: The line that best represents the relationship between the x and y variables.

The animation uses randomly generated data points and visually demonstrates how the best-fit line is computed through the **least-squares regression** method.

### üì¶ **Installation & Requirements**

To run the code, you need to have **Manim** and **NumPy** installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear_regression_manim.git
   cd linear_regression_manim
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   * For macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate```
* For Windows:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
