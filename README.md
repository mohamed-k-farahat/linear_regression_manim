Linear Regression Visualization with Manim
This repository contains a visual demonstration of the Linear Regression algorithm using Manim, a powerful mathematical animation library. The project visualizes how the algorithm calculates the best-fit line by minimizing errors (residuals) between predicted and actual values.

🧑‍💻 Project Overview
The animation in this project demonstrates the following:

Linear Regression: Visualizing how the algorithm fits a line to a set of data points.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Highlighting how errors between the predicted values and the actual data points are minimized.
Best-Fit Line Calculation: The line that best represents the relationship between the x and y variables.
The animation uses randomly generated data points and visually demonstrates how the best-fit line is computed through the least-squares regression method.

📦 Installation & Requirements
To run the code, you need to have Manim and NumPy installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-manip.git
cd linear-regression-manip
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
🔧 Running the Code
After setting up the environment, you can generate the animation by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
manim -pql linear_regression.py LinearRegressionScene
This will generate a low-quality preview of the animation. You can adjust the quality by changing -pql to -pqh or -pqm for higher quality.

The animation will be saved in the media/videos directory by default.

📖 Code Explanation
linear_regression.py: This is the main script where the animation is created. The script includes:
Generating random data points.
Plotting the data points on a graph.
Calculating the best-fit line using the least-squares regression method.
Highlighting the residuals to show how errors are minimized.
Manim Configuration: The Manim library is used to create the animation. You can modify the number of points, the size of the graph, and other visual elements to suit your needs.
🔍 Key Features
Random Data Generation: Random data points are generated to demonstrate how linear regression works on different datasets.
Best-Fit Line: The algorithm uses the least-squares method to calculate and display the best-fit line.
Residuals: The differences between the actual data points and the predicted values (errors) are visualized.
Dynamic Animation: Smooth transitions and animations are created to make the explanation clear and engaging.
